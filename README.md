# BikeSharingNeuralNetwork
My first neural network which uses bike sharing data to predict bike sharing on a given day.

## Create Conda Environment
I used conda and jupyter notebook to create the project. To recreate the conda environment use: </br>
<b>conda env create -f ./environment.yml</b> </br>
Where <i>./environment.yml</i> is the environment file located in this project.
